# wordfinder
nested hash algorithm to search for strings in a dataset in constant time

Upload a list of strings (ideally names or ids where max_string_size < 20)

Use wordfinder to search a second list of strings in the first.

The load up of the first list in wordfinder can provide it with the ability to search each string in constant time or 1 search per character.
